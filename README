========================

MS Exchange Server 2003/2007 backup utility. This allows you to back up
XML-backed data "folders" in Exchange to an XML dump which can be transformed
via XSL into something useful.

This is necessary because the bright folks at Microsquish decided that it
was better to invent their own XML format/protocol on top of WebDAV, which
makes it impossible to use vanilla IMAP to back up contacts, calendar items,
and other "Outlook specific" data.

To build, use "mvn package"

To run, use "java -jar target/exchangebackup-VERSION.jar". Specifying no
options will explain the parameters.
